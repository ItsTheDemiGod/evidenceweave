# EvidenceWeave — CLAUDE.md (single source of truth)

## Project overview
- EvidenceWeave is a log-correlation agent that reads mixed log sources (Linux auth.log, nginx/Apache access logs, Windows event logs as JSON).
- It normalizes them into one event schema.
- Deterministic correlation rules detect the attack chain.
- A local LLM (Ollama) writes an incident narrative where every sentence cites event IDs; a verifier checks those citations.
- Output is an HTML report, evaluated against a synthetic answer key.

## Hard constraints
- Completely free and local: Ollama only, no paid APIs.
- Python 3.10+.
- Minimal dependencies (requests, jinja2, pytest).
- Deterministic rules find the attack chain; the LLM only narrates.
- Every narrative claim must cite event IDs.

## Models
- Primary: `qwen2.5:7b-instruct` (override with env `EVIDENCEWEAVE_MODEL`).
- Secondary: `llama3.1:8b` (model comparison).
- Installed but unused: `qwen3-vl:8b-instruct`, `qwen3-vl:8b`. Do not pull any other models.

## Architecture
generator -> parsers -> normalized events -> correlation rules -> narrator -> verifier -> HTML report -> evaluation against the answer key

Package layout: `evidenceweave/{generator,parsers,correlation,narrator,verifier,report}`, plus `cli.py`, `schema.py`, `config.py`.

## Planned event schema
`event_id`, `timestamp` (UTC), `host`, `user`, `src_ip`, `source_type`, `action`, `raw_file`, `raw_line`, `raw_text`

## Planned attack storyline (PLANNED — not implemented)
1. Brute-force on SSH from one IP
2. Successful login
3. Suspicious process or sudo
4. Persistence via a new cron job or new user
5. Web-log scan from the same IP

## Phase plan
- [x] Phase 0 Setup
- [ ] Phase 1 Synthetic log generator + answer key
- [ ] Phase 2 Parsers + normalized schema
- [ ] Phase 3 Correlation rules
- [ ] Phase 4 LLM narrator with citations
- [ ] Phase 5 Citation verifier + retry loop
- [ ] Phase 6 HTML report + evaluation + demo prep

## Working rules (Claude Code)
- Work on one phase at a time; never start the next phase until the user says so.
- At the end of every phase update this file: tick the phase, add a progress log entry (date, what was built, files created, test results, decisions/problems).
- Keep the "Decisions" and "Open issues" sections current.
- Run tests before finishing a phase.

## Decisions
- venv built from the standard Windows Python 3.12 (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\Python312`), not the MSYS2 `python` on PATH, which creates a non-standard `.venv/bin` layout without `Scripts\Activate.ps1`.

## Open issues
- None.

## Progress log
### Phase 0 — 2026-10-27
- Built: folder structure, venv, requirements.txt, .gitignore, config.py, schema.py (dataclass placeholder), CLI with placeholder subcommands, scripts/check_ollama.py, smoke tests.
- Files: `evidenceweave/{__init__,cli,schema,config}.py`, subpackage `__init__.py` files, `scripts/check_ollama.py`, `tests/test_smoke.py`, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, `data/.gitkeep`, `CLAUDE.md`.
- check_ollama: qwen2.5:7b-instruct replied in 5.6s, llama3.1:8b in 11.1s (includes model load).
- Tests: see commit; smoke tests pass.

## How to run (Windows PowerShell)
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1        # activate venv
python -m pytest                    # run tests
python -m evidenceweave.cli --help  # run CLI
python scripts\check_ollama.py      # check Ollama + models
```
